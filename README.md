# Saliva microbiome in COVID-19 and control patients

We aimed to elucidate the relationship between the saliva microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 53 COVID-19 patients and 59 controls. We used 16S rRNA (V1-V2) sequencing to compare microbiome diversity and taxonomic composition between COVID-19 cases and controls and with varying SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the saliva as measured using RT-PCR. While microbiome diversity did not differ between cases and controls, we identified differential enrichment of several salivary taxa based on saliva SARS-CoV-2 viral load.
